Build faster by me. Already Я haven't limit in js. GodMode has turned ON!
JsBin fullEditor: https://jsbin.com/tofeluf/edit?html,css,js,output
JsBin jsFile: https://output.jsbin.com/tofeluf.js
JsBin Live: https://output.jsbin.com/tofeluf
GitHub.js: https://molnaristvan95.github.io/limitless/god.js

How does it works?

1) Embead source of my library to your HTML.head tag:
jsbin:
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://output.jsbin.com/tofeluf.js"></script>
github:
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://molnaristvan95.github.io/limitless/god.js"></script>

2) Create a new empty script tag in ypur HTML before the closing BODY tag, or simple write the callbacks to your js.
Simple empty script for my callbacks:
<script type="text/javascript"></script>

CallBack my functions(); Under this i'll up to date always new functions how does they working with examples.

Functions(){...} ↓

1) callBack();
"slideDownOnce(id, time, funcId, how, delay, px, more);"
-id = id of element;
-time = what the load time? 500 = 0.5s;
-funcId = how much functions do u want - always make for them sequence number(1,2,3....);
-how = click / auto - how do u want to load the function;
-delay = u can before load the them to pause for example for 2 senonds like : 2000(ms);
-px = how much pixels load per time(second point)
-more = before downSlide your element u can set the height of that by multiplying the font size height which info my func load alone.--
--For example u set 1.5 and your font size in the element is 10px than will be the start size is 15px;
I hope it's clear when the starting size equal to the finishing size, than my func will do nothing.
Try my sets but change for your id the first parameter:
"slideDownOnce('yourElementId', 1, 1, 'click', 0, 0.5, 1.5);"
"slideDownOnce('yourElementId2', 1, 1, 'auto', 5000, 0.5, 1.5);"

Note: Jsbin always ubgraded but git can maybe late. 
Enjoy my work! Here i will not stop to code (=
I'm tryin' to upgrade this git in every week.
